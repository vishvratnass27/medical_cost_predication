# Medical Cost Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict medical costs based on different features like age, smoking status, and more. It employs various techniques such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Polynomial Regression to make accurate predictions.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.

2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the following steps:

   - Load the medical cost dataset (`medical_cost_prediction.csv`).
   - Explore the data with summary statistics and handle any missing values.
   - Create a Linear Regression model to predict charges based on age.
   - Evaluate the model using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Visualize the model's predictions against the test data.
   - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Apply Polynomial Regression to capture complex relationships between features.
   - Standardize the data and fit a Linear Regression model on it.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and compare it to the previous model.
   - Additionally, Ridge and Lasso Regression models are trained and evaluated for comparison.

## Results

- The Linear Regression model predicts medical costs based on age.
- One-hot encoding is used to handle categorical variables.
- Polynomial Regression captures complex relationships between features.
- Ridge and Lasso Regression models are applied to reduce overfitting.
- Evaluation metrics such as R-squared and MAE are used to assess model performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of different regression techniques for medical cost prediction. Depending on your data and requirements, you can choose the most suitable regression method.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to apply it to your own datasets or use it as a starting point for similar regression tasks.
